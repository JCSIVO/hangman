Recreation of the hangman game

// Development of the Hangman game (HangMan) in C# by JCSIVO (12-23-2022).

// Program logic.
/*
* 1. From a set of prefixed words, the team picks one at random.
* 2. The word chosen in the previous point is shown as hidden and shows a series of hyphens (--- ---).
* 3. The user chooses a letter
* 4. It checks if the letter entered is part of the one chosen at random and
* in case NO, the user loses a total attempt of the word.
* 5. If the letter SI is part, the player does not lose any attempt and that word is replaced by the corresponding hyphens.
* 6. The program must be within a repetition structure (from point two), until the user
* hit ALL the word or run out of TRIES.
